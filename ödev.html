 <p><h1>What is<font color="#ff3300"> AngularJS</font>?</p></h1><hr> 
    <p><h3>Angular JS is a structural framework for dynamic web applications. Although it allows to use HTML as a template language, 
        <br>one of its biggest advantages is that it is supported by google. For this reason, it is widely used.

        Compared to other JS libraries, it enables much more work to be done thanks to the codes written shorter.<br>
        
        Angular eliminates most of the code without having to write bulk code, 
        <br>making it an ideal partner to work with almost any server technology found in most browsers.</h3></p>
       <br>
          <br><p><h1>How To <font color="#ff3300">Install </font>AngularJS?</h1></p>
       <hr><p><h3>First we need to install NodeJS. We need to download and install 
            Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/.After the Node.js installation is finished, 
            we need to open the cmd screen and install Angular via npm (Node Package Manager).
             Doing this is as simple as below.
             npm install -g @angular/cli

             we write the command and run it. We are performing the angular/cli installation via NPM.
              Where -g is written to ensure that it loads globally.
              After the installation process has been completed,
               we can now start developing our Angular applications.</h3></p>

               <br> <p><h1>What Are The Uses Of AngularJS?</h1></p>
       <hr> <p><h3>Angular is a javascript library developed and supported by Google that allows you to create a 
            SPA(Single Page Application) application. You can do development depending on the angular model view
             controller structure.
             If .net you are a net developer and have used the MVC structure, you can master Angular more easily.</h3></p>

             <p><h4>NG-APP Directive
                The ng-app directive is captured by the HTML element of the implementation of the Angularjs implementation.
     This directive will automatically run the application when the application page finishes loading.</h4></p>

     <p><h4>NG-INIT Directive
        The ng-init directive allows us to define an initial value for an expression for the current carrier scope,
         not much use for page readability reduction in terms of MVC structure.</h4>

        <p><h4>NG-BIND Directive
            With the ng-bind directfit you can link any element in scope to any element on the DOM. With this mechanic, which we call data binding, 
            changes to the variable will be instantaneously applied to the DOM element content as well.</h4></p>

<p><h4>NgModeles configure the injector and the compiler and help organize related things together.

    Ng-Modele takes a metadata object that describes how to compile a component's template and
     how to create an injector at runtime. It identifies the modele's own components, directives, and pipes, 
     making some of them public, through the exports property, so that external components can use them.
    Ng-Modele can also add service providers to the application dependency injectors.</h4></p>

    <p><h4>Binds the given expression to the value of the element.

        It is mainly used on input[radio] and option elements, so that when the element is selected,
         the ngModel of that element (or its select parent element) is set to the bound value. 
         It is especially useful for dynamically generated lists using ngRepeat, as shown below.
        
        It can also be used to achieve one-way binding of a 
        given expression to an input element such as an input[text] or a textarea,
         when that element does not use ngModel.
